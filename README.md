# Mapping-of-divergent-promoters
Mapping of TSS's in various tissues to find divergent promoters

In this project we gathered data, using the CAGE-seq protocol,
from 16 different types of tissues keeping separate files for
control and disease cases. Through processing the data, after
we located the divergent promoters, we studied the interactions
between the involved genes (e.g. protein coding :: long non-
coding RNA) and the transcription factors that are involved.
Our goal is to observe if there are any differences between
control and disease samples for each tissue.
